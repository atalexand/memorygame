plot twist: use nlp!


I would have wanted the paper to touch more on why people abandon their goals. I feel like that would be a good follow up.

increase retargeting for certification ads to high likely to finish students

you could use a mooc as a summer course for pre-work on a course to evaluate a likely to succeed student.

in addition maybe completion rate isn't the success metric that researchers should consider as they research MOOCs. Completing a course and getting a passing grade is the traditional school's method of mesuring success, but maybe moocs should consider multiple means of success. Students may not be seeking completion.  

because MOOCs are open to the entire public they

Questions:

was the planning exercise the cause of the completion or was the performance on the planning exercise sympotamatic of the kind of person who will complete a course.

i would want to understand why someone is taking a course in concert with their plans.

if you signaled the type language that was indicitive of course completion does that influence completion rates. can ou change mindset with goal setting,  if people create plans that are more inclusive of D, does that increase personal investment into the task.

Possible future interventions to test:
auto add people to study group
repeat the planning exercise intervention multiple times
